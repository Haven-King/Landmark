# Landmark
Landmark is a small but powerful mod that gives names to the various structures players can encounter in Minecraft, and let them define and name structures of their own!

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RhR6XxMyY)

Current Structures with Name Generators:
* Desert Pyramid
* Villages (Desert, Snowy, Other)
* End City
* Mansion
* Shipwreck
* Nether Fortress
* Bastion Remnant

Landmark and name generator definition is entirely data driven! See [here](https://github.com/Hephaestus-Dev/Landmark/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/landmark) for the built-in generators.

Players can currently only obtain deeds through the creative menu.

Huge thanks to Emily, from [Fantasy Name Generators](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/) for allowing me to use her name pieces. I couldn't have done this without her hard work.
